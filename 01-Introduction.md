# Chapter 1: Introduction to NLP and Data Mining

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Define Natural Language Processing (NLP) and describe its key applications.
- Understand the role of data mining in processing text data.
- Describe common tasks in NLP and how they relate to structured data analysis.
- Recognize how Orange facilitates visual, interactive workflows for NLP.

## 1.1 What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language. It lies at the intersection of computer science, linguistics, and data science.

**Examples of NLP in action:**

- Auto-complete in search engines
- Spam detection in emails
- Sentiment analysis in social media
- Chatbots and virtual assistants

### In Theory

At its core, NLP converts **unstructured language** into **structured data** suitable for analysis. This involves several stages such as tokenization, parsing, and classification.

## 1.2 What is Data Mining?

Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, trends, and insights from large datasets using statistical and machine learning techniques.

In the context of NLP, data mining allows us to:
- Cluster similar documents
- Classify text into categories
- Extract topics or key phrases

NLP can be seen as a **specialized form of data mining** that focuses on linguistic data.

## 1.3 Overview of the NLP Workflow

The typical NLP pipeline includes:

1. **Text Collection** ‚Äì Obtaining the raw text
2. **Text Cleaning** ‚Äì Removing noise, formatting inconsistencies
3. **Preprocessing** ‚Äì Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal
4. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì BoW, TF-IDF, embeddings
5. **Modeling** ‚Äì Classification, clustering, topic modeling
6. **Evaluation & Interpretation** ‚Äì Assessing model performance and outputs

We'll be working through each of these stages using **Orange**, a visual data mining and machine learning toolkit.

## 1.4 Why Use Orange?

Orange is a user-friendly, drag-and-drop software environment ideal for prototyping and teaching. It allows:

- Visual workflows that promote comprehension
- Easy integration of NLP add-ons and custom widgets
- Quick feedback loops for experimentation

> üí° Orange is not just for beginners ‚Äî it supports scripting in Python for advanced use.

## 1.5 Case Study Preview

Let‚Äôs consider a case where a company wants to classify customer reviews as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. This involves:

- Preprocessing thousands of raw text reviews
- Training a classification model on labeled data
- Automatically categorizing new reviews

We‚Äôll revisit this case later in the book with hands-on exercises.

## Lab Exercise 1: Your First Look at Orange

1. Download and install Orange from [https://orange.biolab.si](https://orange.biolab.si).
2. Open Orange and create a new workflow.
3. Add the following widgets:
   - *Datasets* (from the Data toolbox) ‚Üí to load sample data
   - *Data Table* ‚Üí to preview the dataset
   - *Scatter Plot* (from the Visualize toolbox) ‚Üí to visualize samples
4. Connect the widgets and explore a sample dataset (e.g., "Iris").
5. Use the Scatter Plot to explore the relationships between the features.
6. Save the scatter plot (ex1.png) that best separates the different types of Iris.

![Figure 1. Example Workflow with the Iris dataset and scatter plot](imgs/1-Ex1%20First%20Look.png)

This scatter plot shows the confidence ellipsis.  These confidence ellipsis overlap considerably.  This indicates that the chosen axis, x and y, do not cleanly separate the classes of iris flower breeds from [Edgar Anderson's 1936 Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

> üìù **Reflection:** What kind of insights does a scatter plot give?
