# Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Orange: A Lab-Based Approach

## Course Overview

Welcome to **Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Orange: A Lab-Based Approach**. This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to the fundamentals of NLP using Orange Data Mining, a powerful, open-source tool for data analysis and machine learning. Through this lab book, students will explore key NLP concepts, perform hands-on exercises, and apply both classical and modern techniques to real-world textual data.

### Topics Covered
- **Text Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**
- **Classification and Clustering**
- **Topic Modeling and Unsupervised Learning**
- **Sentiment Analysis, Text Generation, and Question Answering**
- **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reference Augmented Generation (RAG)**

The course emphasizes practical, project-based learning with **real-world datasets**, offering opportunities to:
- Develop intuitive understanding through hands-on exercises
- Apply cutting-edge tools and techniques to solve NLP problems
- Gain a foundational understanding of both classical NLP methods and advanced approaches such as LLMs and RAG

## Course Structure

This lab book is divided into chapters, each focusing on different aspects of NLP. After each chapter, students will engage in **lab exercises** designed to reinforce the concepts learned. The course culminates in a **Capstone Project**, where students will apply their skills to analyze and process messy textual data.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:
- Be proficient in text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Understand and apply common NLP tasks like classification, clustering, and topic modeling.
- Gain hands-on experience with modern techniques such as RAG and LLMs for real-world problem-solving.
- Be able to evaluate and compare different NLP models and techniques.
