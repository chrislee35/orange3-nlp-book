# TODO List

While there are obvious todo items such as finishing the writing, exercise designs, and editing.  There are some less obvious, easy to forget TODO items that I need to track.  That's what I'll focus on here.

## Obvious

* Finish writing the book
* Design the exercises
* Playtest the exercises
* Edit for grammar
* Translate into target languages (TBD)

## Less obvious

* Include a chapter or addendum on installing Ollama (cover Linux, Windows, and Mac)
  * I'll need someone from the community to help with Mac.
* Figure out the processor and disk size requirements to do everything in this book.
  * I think I can approximate this quite well, but I'll do it at the end since I'd have to reset everything.
* Create an interesting corpus for the question and answer exercise and the RAG exercise.
* Scour Biolab's Introduction to Data Science book (orange-lecture-notes) for additional NLP tasks that I should include in the book.
  * Remember that this book is more on practical application than theory. 
  * While exercises are great way to reenforce theory taught in class, the scope quickly becomes outside my ability to write.
  * I will probably add a lot more to text classification, chapter 4, as I have found that to be powerful in a lot of the work I've done, especially with cheap techniques like word2vec and multinomial native bayes or random forest for high-speed processing of messages.
* Make a CSS for the PDF version of the book.  
  * I tried using nlp-book.css, but it looked quite ugly.  I'd like to tweak the format of the PDF a little, but not as much as the web version of the CSS does.
